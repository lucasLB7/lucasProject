# A BIT ABOUT THE WEBSITE:

Html code is kept as simple as possible on a css structure based on the ANIMAL SHELTER project.
I chose this layout due to how simple it is to change or update the style.
<br>
First is a main class background div that contains the entire page. It serves as a solid backbone in which I build my structure. Styling on this is only padding. In this version there is no flex added. Will try adding this flex wrap in another version.

## The profile image:

The profile image on the right is styled to grow on hover. I wanted to add a text on hover as done in the TRAVEL AGENCY project but due do the structure the : : before {} function did not work ..:/
