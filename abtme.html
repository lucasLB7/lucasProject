        <h1>A breif history</h1>
        <p>I was born in Belgium (Veurne) on the 29th July 1991, which makes me 26 years old now.
          <br>At the age of 6 my parents moved to Kenya as they were in the flower industry, so along I came, with my sister.
          <br>After graduating I went straight into the professional world, where I joined my parents company and also worked for a water driling company in Ethiopia.
          <br><br>Since 2015 I own Decomagna ltd, an import company of interior products from Belgium.
          <br><br>We also manufacture furniture & do interior fitouts.
          <br><br>NOTABLE JOBS DONE:
          <br> -Two Rivers mall (2000 square meter concrete works in collaboration with BASF)
          <br> -Lordship 88 Nairobi (44 storey condomonium coming 2019, flooring all appartments)

      <div class="textBoxLeft">
        <p>I've always had a passion for IT. Started using blender for 3d CAD work at the age of 14 and carried through to now.
          <br>Recently I got a 3d printer (Anet A8). It's a cheap but reliable machine that you have to build.
          <br><br>At the moment i am helping a friend out, who is building his very own racing simulator (with moving chair, responsive wheel, etc..)
          <br><br>I have also picked up a passion for Arduino's & Raspberry Pi's the last year & have build a drone, a cnc laser engraver & a robot.
          <br><br>My new project is an automated hydroponics system for regions where water remains a problem.
