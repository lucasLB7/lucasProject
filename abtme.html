          <br>After graduating I went straight into the professional world, where I joined my parents company and also worked for a water driling company in Ethiopia.
          <br><br>Since 2015 I own Decomagna ltd, an import company of interior products from Belgium.
          <br><br>We also manufacture furniture & do interior fitouts.

      <h1>WHY AM I A STUDENT AT MORINGA?</h1>
      <div class="textBoxLeft">
        <p>I've always had a passion for IT. Started using blender for 3d CAD work at the age of 14 and carried through to now.
          <br>Recently I got a 3d printer (Anet A8). It's a cheap but reliable machine that you have to build.
          <br><br>At the moment i am helping a friend out, who is building his very own racing simulator (with moving chair, responsive wheel, etc..):
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/sunea/">Visit his page</a>
          <br><br>I have also picked up a passion for Arduino's & Raspberry Pi's the last year & have build a drone, a cnc laser engraver & a robot.
          <br><br>My new project is an automated hydroponics system for regions where water remains a problem.

        <h1>MY HOBBIES</h1>
        <p>I've always been into gaming.. lol
          <br><br> but eventually that led me to 3D rendering & rigging.
          <br><br> When I have time I like to go climbing in Lukenya. We climb to the top of the hill & camp there overnight.
          <br><br>Otherwise we go to Champaine for rally racing.. Loads of fun!
          <br><br>I used to play golf a lot, but now rarely find the time to do so.
          <br><br>I don't like to go clubbing but I do attend house parties..;)
