        <p>The realization of this website was only made possible thanks to these supports:
          <br> 1. Moringa School (For support, and classes. Main support base) Moringa instructure
          <br> 2. GitHub (For remote version control and backup) Github
          <br> 3. Stack overflow (General look up for most questions and issues I had)
          <br> 4. W3school (same as stackoverflow)
          <br> 5. Youtube
          <br> TESTAMENT I Paul-Lucas Benoit Lambert (id. ek304470) testify that this project was created, tested and published by me alone.
          <br> Although there are elements which I based myself on that was not my work, I have studied the code, understood, modified and replicated it for the purpose of this project.
